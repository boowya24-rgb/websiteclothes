  <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of my website, Simple Style Guide, is to help people find easy and cute outfit ideas without feeling overwhelmed.
    A lot of people want to look stylish but don’t know where to start or feel stressed when trying to choose what to wear.
    My site keeps things simple by giving clear outfit ideas, basic style tips, and inspiration that anyone can use. I want visitors
    to feel confident and enjoy putting outfits together instead of worrying about it. The site is built to be friendly, clean,
    and easy to follow, so every person — no matter their style level — can find something helpful.

    who want casual everyday outfits, students wanting quick ideas, and anyone who likes cute styles without needing expensive brands.
    The audience prefers short tips, clear images, and an aesthetic look that is modern and easy to understand.
